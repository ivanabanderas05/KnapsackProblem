# KnapsackProblem
## Overview
The **Knapsack Problem** asks:  
>Given a set of items, each with its own weight and value, which subset of items to maximize the value without exceeding the knapsack's maximum weight?

This project provides **five different solutions**
1. Dynamic Programming
2. Divide and Conquer (comparing itself with Dynamic programming)
3. Backtracking
4. Backtracking with branch and bound 
5. Branch and bound 

## Features 
- Implemented in Python
- Five different algorithms with a running clock to compare which is quiskest
- Clear comments for easier understanding
